## Prerequisites

Before running the programs, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Download and install the appropriate JDK version for your operating system from [Oracle's JDK Download Page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or use OpenJDK from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

  - For **Windows**: Follow the installation wizard and set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.
  - For **macOS**: Use Homebrew: `brew install openjdk`.
  - For **Linux**: Install via your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk` for Ubuntu).
